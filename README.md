# movieRecommendation
A python server for movie recommendation

## Description
This project is meant to be used as a guide only.
It simply illustrates how to write a movie recommendation algorythm with python.
Therefore, it can be used as an example if you are willing to:
- Create a python server using twisted.
- Create, read and write a database using sqlalchemy.
- Develop and use a recommendation algorythm. I personnaly relied on this paper to write my algorythm: http://editions-rnti.fr/render_pdf.php?p=1000501&p10

## Installation

pip install blist
